00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,410
hello everyone and welcome to a really

2
00:00:02,669 --> 00:00:06,060
wild game that happened today in the

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:07,799
Bandra blitz club and just twenty four

4
00:00:06,060 --> 00:00:10,320
its Magnus Carlsen with the white beast

5
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:14,250
against Neil's Grande alias and as a

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:16,289
Carlson said in the in the industry that

7
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:18,960
it's we have this ridiculous situation

8
00:00:16,289 --> 00:00:22,439
of a Norwegian playing a Swede and we're

9
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:25,769
both speaking English which is somewhat

10
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:28,710
unusual I imagine as both of both of

11
00:00:25,769 --> 00:00:31,230
their languages are well they're not not

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,420
exactly the easiest of languages but

13
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:36,390
okay I mentioned in the previous video

14
00:00:33,420 --> 00:00:38,670
that I do have some well joyous news so

15
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:39,930
here it is as there are pretty much well

16
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:41,520
pretty much all of the tournaments are

17
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:43,649
canceled in 2020

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,750
today they published that the

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:47,789
Grantchester canceled all of their

20
00:00:45,750 --> 00:00:49,950
events for 2020 so there will be no

21
00:00:47,789 --> 00:00:51,570
events of the Grantchester and it

22
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,180
continues in 2021

23
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:57,719
but Magnus announced on Twitter that he

24
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:00,390
is organizing the biggest online chess

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,649
tournament ever it's the so called there

26
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:05,700
you have it the Magnus Carlsen

27
00:01:01,649 --> 00:01:07,860
Invitational it's 250 thousand dollars

28
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:10,049
prize fund super tournament with eight

29
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:13,830
top players I don't know if it's exactly

30
00:01:10,049 --> 00:01:14,610
eight top or maybe eight of the top 20

31
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,240
or something like that

32
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:20,400
and he didn't specify anywhere will he

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,890
actually be playing I imagine he will

34
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,080
but it wasn't I don't think it was

35
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:26,340
mentioned anywhere and it's gonna start

36
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:30,890
April 18th

37
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:35,250
so in 16 days and it's gonna last for

38
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:37,049
four seven days as it will be seven

39
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:38,549
rounds a single round-robin and there

40
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:40,560
you have it this is a historic moment

41
00:01:38,549 --> 00:01:42,420
for chess and given that it's possible

42
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,909
to continue top professional play in an

43
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,860
online environment we have not only the

44
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,780
opportunity but the responsibility the

45
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:50,850
players and fans around the world who

46
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,740
need a distraction and when no other

47
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:55,500
life competitive sport is being played

48
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:56,189
there we have it so it's gonna be it's

49
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:58,979
gonna be awesome

50
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:01,500
as there are pretty much no events

51
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:04,680
currently going on and I think this is

52
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:06,570
only the first of many to come but

53
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,729
getting back to the game cross and in

54
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:11,430
this game opens with Knight to f3 he

55
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:13,890
goes for the red team sorry about that

56
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:19,170
we have c5 baigan Elias

57
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:22,620
now g3 we have g6 and c3 now slow

58
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:26,640
playing it with d4 and so on we rush up

59
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,610
to g7 and now we have d4 Knight to f6

60
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,530
and the bishop to g2 so both players

61
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,040
feeling get to their Kings side with

62
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:36,570
castles and now cousin says that okay if

63
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:39,390
you're offering me upon our I'm gonna

64
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:41,400
capture it so D captures on c5 and of

65
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:44,700
course if you don't want to allow b4 to

66
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:48,239
solidify the position a 5 now keeping an

67
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:50,760
eye on b4 Carlsen castles and this is a

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,130
new move now so already as a move 7 it's

69
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,290
a completely new game with Knight to a

70
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:57,480
spec sigmund alias precursor to grab

71
00:02:55,290 --> 00:03:01,070
back his pawn and now Bishop to e3

72
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:04,380
defending it we have Knight to g4 now

73
00:03:01,070 --> 00:03:08,070
threatening to double up both not only

74
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:10,380
the C pawns but also add the e pawns so

75
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:13,230
push up to d4 offering a trade of dark

76
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:15,680
square Bishop c5 and now of course as

77
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:18,780
the bishop has no normal good squares h3

78
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:22,560
now we have ecad for Sundy for H CalPERS

79
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,420
on g4 d captures on c3 Knight captures

80
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,130
and now Knight captures on c5 black

81
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:27,780
regained his pawn and we have this

82
00:03:26,130 --> 00:03:29,850
position where cross and spawn structure

83
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:31,920
is a little messed up but he has to

84
00:03:29,850 --> 00:03:34,440
point Islands gonna Daly says three so

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,079
it's it's a trade off and he goes for g5

86
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:39,630
as the the pawn on g4 might might become

87
00:03:37,079 --> 00:03:42,060
a weakness at some point so the six

88
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:44,070
procuring term develop the light square

89
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:47,280
bishop also d6 could be an issue for

90
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:49,530
black with Queen to d2 now with further

91
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,970
defense of the g5 point and also

92
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:51,810
preparing to bring the rook sin to the

93
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,930
game

94
00:03:51,810 --> 00:03:58,019
rook to b8 the candelas prepares b5 and

95
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:02,940
rook F to d1 now threatening to pick up

96
00:03:58,019 --> 00:04:04,769
the d6 pawn with b5 now and cousin does

97
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,430
not go after the phone he just starts

98
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:09,870
improving his pieces we have night to d4

99
00:04:07,430 --> 00:04:11,940
sorry that's not the correct

100
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:15,420
night-nights the d4 the other night

101
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:18,989
coming to d5 and now Bishop to d7

102
00:04:15,420 --> 00:04:21,120
we have Knight to d5 and rook to e8 and

103
00:04:18,989 --> 00:04:22,860
already here our constants position is

104
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,780
is very good he has two excellently

105
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:27,060
placed Knights here the queen is coming

106
00:04:24,780 --> 00:04:27,660
to four which is his next move Queen to

107
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,370
f4

108
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,140
and already there are some threats of

109
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:32,610
knife to have six check where black will

110
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:35,190
have to give up the dark square bishop

111
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:38,220
and it could be a bit dangerous so here

112
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:40,260
point is if you go Bishop to e5 then a

113
00:04:38,220 --> 00:04:42,840
white can still go for this Knight to f6

114
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:44,730
check and now Queen will capture and

115
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,250
after G captures the Bishop captures an

116
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:50,160
F for leaving Carlsen with a triple F

117
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:53,670
pawn but with with definitely a playable

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:57,750
position so if anything even even white

119
00:04:53,670 --> 00:05:00,270
can be better here as f5 is coming so

120
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:02,850
not really not really a problem but

121
00:05:00,270 --> 00:05:05,880
instead Green Day Lewis went for rook

122
00:05:02,850 --> 00:05:08,430
the e5 keeping an eye just on everything

123
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,650
also putting pressure on the g5 for now

124
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:14,280
and now Carlsen just goes Knight to f6

125
00:05:10,650 --> 00:05:17,610
with check we have Bishop Catherine's on

126
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:19,740
f6 G captures on f6 cause I mentioned in

127
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:21,960
the stream that he hopes that this pawn

128
00:05:19,740 --> 00:05:25,080
survives long enough to stir some

129
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,340
trouble in blacks camp but a green

130
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:28,800
village so of course is not going to

131
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:31,530
make it easy for him he goes g5 he kicks

132
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,820
away the Queen and now it's possible to

133
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:34,710
go back with the Queen cousin even

134
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,050
mentions this briefly in the stream that

135
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:40,050
probably Queen d2 is just the best but

136
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:42,810
it's too much fun not capture the rook

137
00:05:40,050 --> 00:05:45,570
on e5 and for this decision we are

138
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:47,400
awarding Magnus the morphe head so there

139
00:05:45,570 --> 00:05:50,250
you have it Carson gets the morphe head

140
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:54,120
and the game continues he goes for Queen

141
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:57,360
captures on e5 and what's happening here

142
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:59,790
why why did he give up the Queen well he

143
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:02,070
captures on e5 by black and now Knight

144
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:04,140
the c6 putting pressure on the Queen the

145
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:07,440
rook of course you cannot capture as the

146
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:10,080
due to the pin Knights the e7 check is

147
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,720
an idea in some lines and it's just it's

148
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:14,730
just gonna win back some material so

149
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,680
point is do you would do defend the rook

150
00:06:14,730 --> 00:06:18,330
or do you play Queen captures on f6 in

151
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:20,640
the game of Queen captures and f6 was

152
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:22,650
played but Queen to c7 is also very

153
00:06:20,640 --> 00:06:25,200
interesting as we get a knight captures

154
00:06:22,650 --> 00:06:27,930
rook Queen captures night and now rook a

155
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:31,050
to see one threatening just eliminate

156
00:06:27,930 --> 00:06:32,880
the defender of the d7 Bishop so after

157
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:34,470
Queen to a7 or any move you're still

158
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,500
gonna capture and after Queen captures

159
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:38,820
you're gonna capture on d7 and you get

160
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:40,410
this position where it's Queen against

161
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:41,100
the rook and the bishop but it's not

162
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:42,990
easy

163
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,700
black plus with the de-spawn here white

164
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:47,910
threatening checkmate you have to play

165
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:52,290
Queen b6 regarding this and now it's

166
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:54,300
it's a well Bishop to b5 will have to be

167
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:56,910
played going after the f7 pawn and after

168
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:58,770
captures just captures and you go into

169
00:06:56,910 --> 00:07:03,030
this King and pawning him after all this

170
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:05,070
madness where black has a bit more

171
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:06,740
active King but all and all after g4

172
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:09,780
should be should be something of a draw

173
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:12,210
so Knight the c6 really are complicated

174
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,400
the move especially for for a 3-minute

175
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:16,740
blitz game and here we have Queen

176
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:20,400
captures and f6 instead by grant Ellis

177
00:07:16,740 --> 00:07:22,380
he gives up the rook on b8 and goes for

178
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,400
a different idea with Knight captures on

179
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:29,460
b8 and Bishop to e6 now so this is this

180
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:31,920
is the line he prefers rook a to c1

181
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:36,240
going after the night and now Knight to

182
00:07:31,920 --> 00:07:38,580
a4 so it's a bit of a different bit of a

183
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,590
different everything in that game black

184
00:07:38,580 --> 00:07:42,570
shouldn't have any problems but here

185
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:44,970
it's it's not at all clear what's

186
00:07:42,570 --> 00:07:47,910
happening here across and one goes for

187
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:50,280
Knight to d7 he attacks the Queen Queen

188
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:53,010
to e7 now with a double attack on the

189
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:55,980
night and now b3 attacking the knight

190
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:58,530
and here what do you do you cannot move

191
00:07:55,980 --> 00:08:00,270
the knight as well it doesn't really

192
00:07:58,530 --> 00:08:02,400
have all that many good squares but the

193
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:04,830
problem is what do you play Bishop

194
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,170
captures and d7 is definitely best here

195
00:08:04,830 --> 00:08:08,970
because now you have to capture the

196
00:08:07,170 --> 00:08:11,120
night if you go look to see 7 here then

197
00:08:08,970 --> 00:08:13,950
the night just wiggles out nice to be

198
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:17,520
610 defends the bishop and after Bishop

199
00:08:13,950 --> 00:08:20,100
h3 adding a third attacker against the

200
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,690
bishop on d7 now Queen d8 defense but

201
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,920
also attacks the rook forces you to

202
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,110
capture with the rook

203
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:26,610
so after okay seven Queen b8 the Queen

204
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:27,780
follows the rook and now you're gonna

205
00:08:26,610 --> 00:08:29,700
have to give up the rook captures

206
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:31,110
captures and captures and again you have

207
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:33,180
a queen against the rook and Bishop but

208
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:35,580
here it's a bit more promising for for

209
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:37,260
black so like I said after Bishop

210
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:40,590
captures and b7 you would have to go for

211
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:42,210
B captures on a4 and then wait for for

212
00:08:40,590 --> 00:08:44,099
white to recapture now the thread is

213
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:45,420
rook c7 to go after the bishop so you

214
00:08:44,099 --> 00:08:47,520
have to play something like this give up

215
00:08:45,420 --> 00:08:49,860
the pawn and then after characters the

216
00:08:47,520 --> 00:08:51,180
game just continues to where it's due to

217
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:53,550
rooks and Bishop against the Queen and

218
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:54,810
the bishop still anything can happen as

219
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,300
it is a three minute

220
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:59,340
blades game so here Grendel is instead

221
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:01,590
of capturing which is definitely the

222
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:04,170
best idea goes for Knights to be to puts

223
00:09:01,590 --> 00:09:06,540
pressure on the rook and now look the d2

224
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:09,000
by Carlson attacking the knight and now

225
00:09:06,540 --> 00:09:11,100
again it's not it's not easy to play

226
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:13,620
because now if the ship characters nb7

227
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:15,570
now you play rook to c7 you will win

228
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,830
back the bishop and the knight is trap

229
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:19,140
the knight has nowhere to go

230
00:09:16,830 --> 00:09:20,850
so whatever black plays before let's say

231
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:22,620
you're gonna win the bishop captures

232
00:09:20,850 --> 00:09:24,450
here and after the Queen moves you're

233
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:26,850
gonna deliver a check and pick up the

234
00:09:24,450 --> 00:09:28,080
knight unbe - and then it's going to be

235
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:30,570
two rooks and the bishop against the

236
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:33,480
Queen of course much better for white so

237
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:36,270
Grandal is instead went Queen to a3 the

238
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:39,000
guard the night and now Magnus went for

239
00:09:36,270 --> 00:09:42,180
Knight to c5 it's a similar idea he

240
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:45,029
wants them he wants to prevent the

241
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:47,370
Bishop captures night and then deal with

242
00:09:45,029 --> 00:09:50,250
the night and beat you but there is an

243
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:51,630
even more forcing line so feel free to

244
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:54,779
pause the video here and try to find

245
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:55,980
this well idea that it's it's a bit too

246
00:09:54,779 --> 00:09:57,750
elusive for a three minute

247
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:59,610
let's game but you are comfortable in

248
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,680
your own home so maybe maybe you want to

249
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:06,900
give it a shot well I give you a couple

250
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,430
of seconds so for those of you who were

251
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:11,790
able to do it congratulations I'm

252
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:13,380
spotting the this instant winning idea

253
00:10:11,790 --> 00:10:13,890
and for those of you who just want to

254
00:10:13,380 --> 00:10:17,370
enjoy the show

255
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:19,890
it's Knight to f6 width check King has

256
00:10:17,370 --> 00:10:22,050
to move now there's no longer the threat

257
00:10:19,890 --> 00:10:23,460
of rush of characters 97 but the

258
00:10:22,050 --> 00:10:25,680
difference between this and mark

259
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,390
Magnus's move is that this comes with

260
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,980
checks so next one we're going to just

261
00:10:27,390 --> 00:10:30,720
play rook c2 and win the night as the

262
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:33,060
knight has nowhere to go so at least

263
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,760
King g7 you go after the knight Knight

264
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:38,940
delivers check again you again go after

265
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,650
tonight and now Knight the c7 so

266
00:10:38,940 --> 00:10:43,500
basically similar to what cost and

267
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:45,450
achieved but his night is on c5 but it

268
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:47,880
is a bit different because now to

269
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:50,160
prevent rook to c2 you have to go Bishop

270
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:52,589
a5 but now efore just kicks away the

271
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,870
bishop bishop here and now you just win

272
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,670
the knight and the white will have well

273
00:10:54,870 --> 00:10:59,310
- too much material and in the winning

274
00:10:56,670 --> 00:11:01,620
advantage however magnus played night

275
00:10:59,310 --> 00:11:04,260
the c5 which seems like a similar idea

276
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:06,270
the knight on c5 instead of on c7 but

277
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:08,430
it's actually not here and Elias had the

278
00:11:06,270 --> 00:11:08,640
option of going Bishop to 5 keeping an

279
00:11:08,430 --> 00:11:11,550
eye

280
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:14,130
the C 2 square and after E for now he

281
00:11:11,550 --> 00:11:16,920
would have Knight to c4 but of course

282
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:18,960
impossible to spot with with in a

283
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:21,180
three-minute blitz game now you just

284
00:11:18,960 --> 00:11:23,160
well the rook is under attack so you

285
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:25,050
have to do something about that and also

286
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,550
this rock is under attack so you have to

287
00:11:25,050 --> 00:11:28,050
do something about that and there is not

288
00:11:26,550 --> 00:11:31,620
much you can do after rook to the 8th

289
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:34,290
check King g7 you will either you will

290
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,390
win this night hunter Luke also has to

291
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:37,800
be moved so you will you will just

292
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:39,860
wiggle out of your problems

293
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:43,170
however Greendale is play tonight the

294
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:45,870
Knights the c4 immediately without the

295
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:47,490
inclusion of Bishop to f5 but now it's a

296
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:50,220
bit different because now rook to b8

297
00:11:47,490 --> 00:11:53,430
check by Magnus King to g7 and now

298
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:55,680
Knight captures an e6 width check that's

299
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:57,930
the problem now that the king is in g7f

300
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,090
characters on e6 and now of course not

301
00:11:57,930 --> 00:12:03,840
captures as the rook is hanging looked

302
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:07,140
the c2 we have night back the b6 now by

303
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:09,990
grand alias and now comes looked the c7

304
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:13,590
width check King to h6 and now of course

305
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:15,660
Bishop to c4 threatening just to gobble

306
00:12:13,590 --> 00:12:18,780
up that h7 pawn which will result in

307
00:12:15,660 --> 00:12:20,640
checkmate so g4 making an escape route

308
00:12:18,780 --> 00:12:23,460
for the King but here Magnus just plays

309
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:25,410
rook the g8 now taking away the g g5

310
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:28,080
square from the black king and next move

311
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:30,300
he's just going to deliver Queen to h7

312
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:31,770
rookie actress on h7 checkmate and that

313
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:33,660
there is nothing you can do about this

314
00:12:31,770 --> 00:12:35,910
there are no tricks there are no checks

315
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:39,180
Quincy one check is not possible as the

316
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,990
rock covers that square so that's that's

317
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:41,850
pretty much it

318
00:12:39,990 --> 00:12:44,250
so after work the g8 to Greendale is

319
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:46,620
resigned the game and this wonderful

320
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:49,920
wonderful victory was achieved by Magnus

321
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:51,810
Carlsen just just beautiful stuff that

322
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:53,010
Queen captures on e5 move we can see it

323
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,680
once again in slow motion

324
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:58,800
so g5 was played and then Queen captures

325
00:12:55,680 --> 00:13:02,760
on e5 just just outstanding they're

326
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:04,440
deserving over morphe head so that's the

327
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:06,420
game I do hope you enjoyed it like I

328
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:08,460
said looking forward to the TD

329
00:13:06,420 --> 00:13:09,570
